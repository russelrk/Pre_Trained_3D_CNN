## Introduction

With the increasing demand for realistic 3D models in various domains such as gaming, virtual reality, disease prediction, and simulation, it's essential to have techniques that facilitate the transfer of knowledge from well-established 2D models to their 3D counterparts. This repository provides both 3D models and a clever technique to transfer weight through dubbed as Dimension Expansion Weight Transfer (DEWT).

## Models

The repository currently includes a ResNet falimily of 3D models created based on the pretrained models available through PyTorch pre-trained models. These models can serve as a starting point for your projects or research, saving you time and effort in the creation process.

## Dimension Expansion Weight Transfer Technique

**Dimension Expansion Weight Transfer (DEWT)** is a technique developed to enable the transfer of pre-trained weights from 2D models to 3D models. Traditional weight transfer methods struggle with the differences in dimensionality between 2D and 3D data. DEWT addresses this issue by strategically expanding dimensions and leveraging techniques from linear algebra and neural network theory.

To learn more about the DEWT technique, its underlying principles, and implementation details, please refer to our dedicated previously published works.
